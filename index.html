        <p class="container-left">There are <span class="important-text">87 million</span> tennis players in the world but only <span class="important-text">3500 to 4000</span> professional tennis players, according to the <span class="important-text">International Tennis Federation (ITF)</span>. Of those professional players, there are only a handful that make it big and take home a grand prize from some of the most exclusive tournaments. So the question is: what makes a winner in tennis?  There are obviously many factors to consider, but today we will only focus on a few; <span class="important-text">country, physical characteristics and court surface</span>. Lastly we will look at the <span class="important-text">top 5 champions of all time</span> to really highlight the dominance of certain players in tennis. You may have already heard of some of the biggest names in tennis in the modern era, including <span class="roger-federer">Roger Federer,</span> <span class="rafael-nadal">Rafael Nadal</span> and <span class="novak-djokovic">Novak Djokovic</span>. But stay tuned to find out who has won the most tournaments and is the overall leading winner!</p>

        <p class="container-right">The <span class="important-text">Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP)</span> is one of the primary governing organisations for men's professional tennis. Every year the ATP holds a vast range of professional tournaments, including their famous ATP Tour comprising of the <span class="important-text">ATP 250, ATP 500, Masters 1000 and some Grand Slam</span> tournaments. The ATP collects data for each round in each tournament in order to calculate their official rankings of male professional tennis players. Additionally, they also monitor players' performances in the four major Grand Slam tournaments: the <span class="important-text">Australian Open, French Open (also known as Roland-Garros), Wimbledon and the US Open</span>. This data is extremely useful in analysing statistics about all players, however, today we will focus mainly on the overall winners of the tournaments, ranging from 1969 all the way up to 2022.

        <p class="container-left">Like most sports, tennis has undergone huge globalisation due to its growing popularity and has consequently resulted in more and more countries entering the tennis scene. Huge names in tennis have come from all different countries, some of which provide more advantages than others. </p>
        <p class="container-left">
          Countries like the <span class="important-text">United States</span> have seen many greats come and go, with a huge peak in number of wins and high win-rate in the 1970s due to American greats <span class="jimmy-connors">Jimmy Connors</span> and <span class="important-text">John McEnroe</span>. At the same time, <span class="important-text">Australia</span> was also fighting hard to collect titles, with Aussie legends <span class="important-text">Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, John Newcombe</span> and <span class="important-text">Roy Emerson.</span></p>
        <p class="container-left">In the late 1980s <span class="important-text">Sweden</span> and <span class="important-text">Germany</span> begin to ramp up their wins, courtesy of greats <span class="important-text">Mats Wilander</span> and <span class="important-text">Stefan Edberg</span> for Sweden and <span class="important-text">Boris Becker</span> for Germany. Although less apparent, Czech-American tennis legend <span class="ivan-lendl">Ivan Lendl</span> also worked hard to claim eight Grand Slam titles during this time period. </p>
      </div>
      <!-- text para 2 -->
      <div class="pure-u-1-2">
        <p class="container-right">From the 2000s onwards, you can really start to see a large increase in number of wins and a positive win-rate for <span class="important-text">Switzerland, Spain</span> and <span class="important-text">Serbia</span>. This is due to the initiation and subsequent domination by the top three players of the 21st century: <span class="roger-federer">Roger Federer,</span> <span class="rafael-nadal">Rafael Nadal</span> and <span class="novak-djokovic">Novak Djokovic</span>. These three players have very much paved the way for their respective countries and cemented their place in tennis history. </p>
        <p class="container-right">However, it seems that not all countries share the same successes. Many countries in <span class="important-text">South America, Africa, Asia and parts of Europe</span> have yet to reach the levels of their winning counterparts. Although the number of wins may be low, their win-rate fluctuates from below 50% (losing majority of matches) to above 50% every now and then, signalling hope for the future.</p>
        <p class="container-right">Overall it seems that whilst some countries may offer better resources and facilities to their players, it seems that tennis champions can spring up from just about anywhere at anytime, provided they have the talents and means.</p>

        <div class="pure-u-1-2">
            <p class="container-left">A player's physical characteristics definitely have some influence on their chance of winning. Previously it was proven that the <span class="important-text">speed of a player's serve positively correlates with a their height</span>, giving taller people an advantage. At the same time, it's widely known that a <span class="important-text">player generally peaks in their youth</span>. What about if we combine these two statistics to see the demographic of winners? </p>
            <p class="container-left">The graph on the right is a little bit special, you might find it a bit confusing to read at first but it's actually quite simple. The histogram on the top of the graph shows the distribution of <span class="important-text">age groups of winners</span>. We can see that most players fall within the age range of <span class="important-text">20-25 and 25-30</span>, which makes sense as younger players tend to perform better. The histogram on the right of the graph shows the distribution of <span class="important-text">height of winners</span>. This distribution looks similar to the height distribution of the average population, where most players seem to fall between <span class="important-text">180-185cm and 185-190cm tall</span>. This is taller than the average male, who is 170cm.</p>
            <p class="container-left">The heatmap in the graph is the interesting part, which shows us the <span class="important-text">most frequent combinations of the two characteristics</span>. The darkest blue part of the heatmap shows that <span class="important-text emphasise-text">most winners are aged 20-25 with a height of 185-190cm</span>. The surrounding shaded blue cells indicate that most winners are relatively young and taller than the average person.</p>

            <p class="container-right">Another important consideration is the 'handedness' of a player, i.e. are they right- or left-handed. Tennis fans know that a <span class="important-text">left-handed player has an excellent advantage</span>, as their forehand goes crosscourt to their opponent's backhand, their weaker side. However, similar to the statistics of the general population, left-handed players are rare. <span class="leftie">Only 18.79% of tennis winners are left-handed</span>, a statistic that includes famous leftie <span class="rafael-nadal">Rafael Nadal</span>. Although this percentage seems relatively low, it is higher than the percentage of left-handed people in the whole population (10%). This suggests that even though majority of winners are <span class="rightie">right-handed (81.16%)</span>, <span class="leftie">left-handed</span> winners are still a hot commodity in tennis. </p>

      <div class="pure-u-1-4">
        <p class="container-left">The surface of the court is one of the most important factors of the winning chance of a tennis player. The three main types of surface are <span class="clay">clay,</span> <span class="grass">grass</span> and <span class="hardc">hard (concrete)</span> courts. Only <span class="grass">8.96% </span>of matches were played on a Grass court, a surface that<span class="roger-federer">Roger Federer</span> and <span class="important-text">Pete Sampras</span> are known to excel on. Grass courts are generally <span class="important-text">slipperier</span> than the other surfaces and unpredictable due to the nature of grass, namely its uneven surface.</p>
      </div>
      <!-- text para 2 -->
      <div class="pure-u-1-4">
        <p class="container-left container-right">Carpet describes a court generally made of <span class="important-text">artificial turf</span> and became popular because of its ease to maintain compared to grass courts. It used to be one of the surfaces in the ATP Tours but was no longer used after 2009. <span class="carpet">15.47%</span> of matches were played on a Carpet surface, specialty of <span class="important-text">John McEnroe.</span> This surface is also known to favour players with a fast play-style.</p>

      <!-- text para 3 -->
      <div class="pure-u-1-4">
        <p class="container-left container-right">A clay surface was used in <span class="clay">36.53%</span> of matches, which is known to be <span class="rafael-nadal">Rafael Nadal's</span>  forte. Nadal currently holds the record for most French Open titles, with a staggering 14 titles from the tournament notorious for its clay surface. Clay is known to be <span class="important-text">one of the more difficult surfaces to play on</span>, due to its property of slowing down the speed of the ball and causing increased bounce. </p>
      </div>
      <!-- text para 4 -->
      <div class="pure-u-1-4">
        <p class="container-right">Lastly, hard court is the most common with <span class="hardc">39.04%</span> of games played on this court. This surface is considered somewhere between clay and grass, and is a surface many players excel on due to the wide variety of styles players can use. <span class="important-text">Jimmy Connors</span>, <span class="roger-federer">Roger Federer</span> and <span class="novak-djokovic">Novak Djokovic</span> are known for playing well on this surface.</p>

        <div class="pure-u-1-2">
            <p class="container-left">If you've been paying attention, you've probably noticed five names highlighted in different colours throughout this article whilst other names are coloured black. These are the <span class="important-text"> five players that have won the most tournaments of all time (between 1969 and 2022)</span>. The tennis world is known for its ongoing debate about who the best champion is. Talk to a tennis fan and they can spend hours talking to you about all the different reasons one player is better than another and how just because someone has more wins doesn't automatically make them a better player. However, no one can refute the fact that the numbers don't lie; certain players have held a mastery over the game to ultimately take home a plethora of titles.</p>
            <p class="container-left">Namely <span class="jimmy-connors">Jimmy Connors,</span> <span class="roger-federer">Roger Federer,</span> <span class="ivan-lendl">Ivan Lendl,</span> <span class="rafael-nadal">Rafael Nadal</span> and <span class="novak-djokovic">Novak Djokovic</span> are the top 5 players who have earned the most titles (of any tournament, not just Grand Slams). All five have earned an astonishing <span class="important-text">more than 80 wins</span> in their tennis careers! At their peak, some of these champions won <span class="important-text">more than 10 titles a year</span>, with <span class="ivan-lendl">Lendl</span> smashing out a whopping 15 titles in 1984!! This graph also aligns with the map you previously saw, with <span class="jimmy-connors">Connors</span> sweeping out the titles in the 70s, <span class="ivan-lendl">Lendl</span> leading in the 80s, and the Big 3 <span class="roger-federer">Federer</span>, <span class="rafael-nadal">Nadal</span> and <span class="novak-djokovic">Djokovic</span> fighting it out in the 21st century!! </p>
        </div>
        <div class="pure-u-1-2">
            <p class="container-right">Do you remember how there are four major Grand Slams tournaments: the Australian Open, French Open (Roland Garros), Wimbledon and US Open? Only the best of the best play in these tournaments and with <span class="important-text">only four titles available</span> it is incredibly hard to win even just one. The five greatest have continuously dominated in these tournaments, with <span class="roger-federer">Federer</span> and <span class="rafael-nadal">Nadal</span> even winning <span class="important-text">3 out of 4 Grand Slams in the same year</span> multiple times in their career! Filtering for Grand Slam data only, we can see that in the years following 2002, one or more of these prestigious titles has been claimed by Federer, Nadal and Djokovic each year, leaving little space for other players to interject. It also seems that in their time, each of these players dominated the tennis scene for <span class="important-text">more than 15 years</span>!! The top tennis greats have proven themselves to be consistent and persevering in their careers, which has ultimately landed them in the top 5 greatest players of all time.</p>
            <p class="container-right">All in all, being a winner in tennis takes a lot of hard work and perseverance, along with a range of other factors we have explored. So if you have aspirations to become a major tennis star one day, check out these amazing great players to see how they did it and be prepared to put in the effort!</p>
